        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>With over three years of experience in end-to-end data product development, I excel in project management and rapid tech adaptation, leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT to optimize workflows securely. I am proficient in Spark, SQL, docker, Python, and Airflow and deliver innovative solutions that drive tangible results. My collaborative approach fosters knowledge sharing, ensuring I stay updated with industry trends. This enables me to contribute effectively across various projects. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for innovation to the team I work with, contributing to its success.
            I like to work in an environment with an utmost level of uncertainty about how things would be done, which is why I could be mostly found doing coding challenges or playing with data.</p>
